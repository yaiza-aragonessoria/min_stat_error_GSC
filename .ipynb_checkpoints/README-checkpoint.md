# Minimising the statistical error in the calibration of quantum-gate sets
Calibration of quantum gates is a necessary hurdle to overcome on the way to a reliable quantum computer. In a recent paper, a protocol called Gate Set Calibration protocol (GSC) has been introduced and used to extract coherent errors from multi-qubit quantum gates. Here, we extend this study in two ways. First, we take the uncertainty of any measurement in the protocol into account by performing a statistical analysis. Second, we optimize the statistical uncertainty, while also requiring that the protocol involves only a small number of distinct gates, aiding physical realizability. We numerically demonstrate that, just by adding two more single- qubit gates to GSC, the statistical error produced in the calibration of a CNOT gate is divided by a factor of more than two.
