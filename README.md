Project Title: Statistical Error Minimization in Quantum Gate Calibration
Abstract:
Calibration of quantum gates is an essential step towards achieving reliable quantum computation. In a recent paper, a protocol named Gate Set Calibration (GSC) has been introduced to extract coherent errors from multi-qubit quantum gates. This project extends the study of GSC in two significant ways. Firstly, it incorporates the uncertainty of measurements into the protocol by conducting a comprehensive statistical analysis. Secondly, it aims to optimize the statistical uncertainty while ensuring that the protocol utilizes a minimal number of distinct gates, thus enhancing physical realizability.

By augmenting the GSC with two additional single-qubit gates, this study demonstrates a remarkable reduction in the statistical error encountered during the calibration of a CNOT gate. Numerical simulations reveal that the statistical error is reduced by more than a factor of two with this augmentation, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed approach.
